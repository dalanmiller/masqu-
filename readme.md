#Welcome to Masqu√©

Did yo uknow that unconsciously your written text has a "voice", much like your spoken voice?

That amongst dozens or even a hundred other people your written text is able to be uniquely identified?

Interestingly enough, it's true. And thanks to research done by the ![Privacy, Security, and Automation Lab](https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Main_Page) at Drexel University we now know that this kind of analysis is possible and if you're worried about maintaing your anonymity online, it is a vector of attack that you should be thinking about.

I've created this handy Chrome Extension to help you mask some of your text input in the web by jumbling the inner text characters around.
